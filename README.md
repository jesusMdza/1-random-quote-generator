Project: Random Quote Generator

This project required me to create a list of random quotes along
with differing properties, such as the quote's source, 
and display them one by one in the browser after a 
time limit (New quote displays every 15 seconds).

When a new quote is displayed, a random color is also selected
and is displayed as the background color.

The quote that was selected was accessed, along with its values, and
printed to the page.
